My app is a trivia game that pulls questions from the OpenTriviaDB API. You can use this to choose the difficulty, category, and number of questions you want to have in your quiz. This is connected to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary API, as when you answer a question, the definition of the correct answer is displayed at the bottom of the screen.

## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?

In this project, I learned how to connect two APIS. It was honestly easier than I had expected it to be. I also played around with JavaFX scenes, using multiple scenes, each one representing a different screen of my trivia game. The prospect of GUI development is exciting to me and I'm excited to play around with it more!

## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch, what do
> you think might do differently and why?

If I could start from scratch, I would do more planning before I started the project. I did a decent amount of planning before starting, but not quite enough. There were a few unexpected problems that popped up and I had to spend some time fixing them. Overall, I think that the work I did on this project is pretty good, and when problems arose, I was able to fix them quickly, but a little bit more planning might be beneficial in the future.
